# Reddit-Clone-API

This is the API for a Reddit Clone application I've been working on these last few weeks. <br>
It's being built using Node.js, Express and MySql.

The API is hosted on Google Cloud.
It also has a Frontend that is hosted on Github Pages: https://lucas-4.github.io/Reddit-Clone-Frontend/
